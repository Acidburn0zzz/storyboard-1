- [ ] Library:
    + [ ] More tests

- [ ] Chrome extension
    + [ ] Add setting: collapseAllNewStories. It will imply cross-state between storyReducer and settingsReducer!
    + [ ] Better way to add listeners than `require 'storyboard/dist/listeners/xxx` ?
    + [ ] Improve perf with very long logs
    - [ ] Forget logs and (closed) stories...
